        <p>The website is called &ldquo;Paws &amp; Claws&rdquo; because it appears to be related to animals as cats and dogs have paws and claws. The overview of project is to make a pet food and supplies E-commerce website that is accessible to pet owners in Malaysia. The main aim of this project is to build the best pet food and supplies E-commerce website in Malaysia.</p>
        <p>Since there are many dog and cat owners in Malaysia, the author plans to provide pet food and supplies to them without having them stepping out from home. This website intends to let them enjoy online shopping. However, our country is suffering problems with stray dogs and cats. These threats can be risky to human if the problems are not addressed appropriately. These problems are mainly caused by irresponsible owners who abandoned their dogs. The solution of these problems is to neuter all the stray animals so that the population will be lessen from time to time, but the fee of neutering is not cheap. Besides that, Non-Profit Organizations (NGOs) like PAWS and SPCA are difficult to house all the stray dogs and cats due to limited resources such as food, places, and money. With the limited resources they possess, it is essential that everyone should bear the burden to solve the problems. With this idea, an E-commerce website that provides news and information about stray problems is then being planned and shaped. It is because most of the pet food and supplies websites do not post information related to those issues. Therefore, the author hopes that this website is bringing quality pet food and supplies to pet owners while raising awareness about stray animal issues happening in our country.</p>
