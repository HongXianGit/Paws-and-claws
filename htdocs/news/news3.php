        <p>KUALA LUMPUR: All parties must be more accommodating and compassionate in handling stray animals.</p>
        <p>Patron of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Selangor Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye said while he understood and appreciated that Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ) dog catchers were clearing the streets of stray dogs, this should be done in a professional manner and with minimal cruelty.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The unfortunate incident between MPSJ dog catchers and print shop owner Koh Tat Meng, 47, has gone viral. Whilst Koh and his wife were pleading with the dog catchers to spare and not catch the dog named &lsquo;Puchong&rsquo;, MPSJ personnel continued with their task and at times were quite aggressive, both physically and verbally, towards Koh.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Koh was detained by police and charged under Section 186 of the Penal Code for obstructing public servants from performing their duties.</p>
        <p>He was later released on bail, lodged a police report against the council and demanded an apology from MPSJ for having him arrested.</p>
        <p>Lee commented that it has come to the public&apos;s and his knowledge that MPSJ intends to charge Koh at Petaling Jaya Magistrates Court for contravention of Section 186 of the Penal Code, which carries an imprisonment term of up to two years or a fine of ten thousand ringgit or both.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is obvious from the video that all that Koh and Diong (his wife) did was to plead verbally for the release of &lsquo;Puchong&rsquo;. Koh did not physically obstruct or prevent the carrying out of the officers&rsquo; duties. I urge MPSJ authorities to drop these charges.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The social activist referred to the Urban Wellbeing Division of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government standard operating procedure (SOP) dated July 9, 2014 for catching stray dogs, stating one of the objectives is to ensure that the catching of stray dogs is carried out without any cruelty.</p>
        <p>The SOP highlights all acceptable methods using noose, trap and nets, and specifically states in Lampiran 7 not to &ldquo;pull, drag and lift dogs with a noose&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Tengku Permaisuri of Selangor, Tengku Permaisuri Norashikin also expressed her regrets over the rough manner shown by the staff of MPSJ in treating the dog during the operation.</p>
        <p>She reminded all parties to take heed of the Animal Welfare Act 2015 which provides for a fine of RM20,000 to RM100,000 or up to three years imprisonment, for those who commit acts of cruelty to animals</p>
